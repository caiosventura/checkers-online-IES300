This is the same game https://github.com/SergeiBan, but players can use two different devices.

You'd just need to click "invite" button and a board number will be given to you, so you can pass it to your friend.
Once the other player enters the number you will be connected and the game begins.

It's under construction right now. As in "not working yet".
